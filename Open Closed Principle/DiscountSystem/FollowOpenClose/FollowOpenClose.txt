The Discount abstract base class defines a method CalculateDiscount for calculating the discount amount.
Concrete classes PercentageDiscount and FixedAmountDiscount inherit from Discount and provide specific 
implementations for calculating discounts based on percentage and fixed amount, respectively.
We can easily extend the discount system by creating new classes that inherit from Discount 
and provide implementations for additional types of discounts (e.g., buy-one-get-one-free, tiered discounts).
