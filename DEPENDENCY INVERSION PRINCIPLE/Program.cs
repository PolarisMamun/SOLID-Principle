 * 🔍WHATDOESDIP MEAN?

    Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a key
    tenet of SOLID design principles in software
    engineering. At its core, DIP advocates for
    decoupling high-level modules from low-level
    implementations, promoting abstraction and
    flexibility in your codebase.
